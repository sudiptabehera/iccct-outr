      1.The manuscript should be prepared in Springer Communications in Computer
      and Information Science (CCIS) format using MS WORD template [download]
      and/or LaTeX template [download]. The guidelines are given which may help
      you to prepare the manuscript. Preferable format of the manuscript is
      LaTeX. These templates and guidelines can also be found on the publisher’s
      homepage by clicking on the ‘Instructions for Authors’ section. 2.The
      figures/graphs/plots in the manuscript MUST be of good resolution (600 dpi
      or more), tables MUST NOT be in pictorial format. Text in figures should
      not be too small, and preferably of equal size as the text of the article.
      3.Figures, text, or tables MUST be visible within the boundary of the
      page’s text area and MUST NOT go beyond it. 4.Do NOT use any Social /
      Academic titles (e.g. Mr., Ms., Dr., Prof., etc) preceding the author’s
      names. Do NOT mention the position of a person (e.g., research scholar,
      student, assistant professor, professor, IEEE member, IEEE student member,
      etc.) in the affiliation. 4.Mention full address, affiliation, and email
      of ALL authors; specify a corresponding author with the corresponding
      e-mail ID. [Once an article is accepted, the publisher will send the
      proofreading of the article to this e-mail]. 5. Do not make any page
      numbering and do not give any running head title. 6.Every article must
      bear a self-composed independent single paragraph as an Abstract, which
      MUST NOT bear any citation or reference. Abstract MUST not have a section
      number. 8.Articles must be written in spell-checked and grammatically
      correct English. 9.All references, figures, and tables should be numbered
      in sequence starting from 1 and MUST be duly cited/referred to within the
      text. 10.Adhere to page size (A4 : 8.27″ x 11.69″), page margin size
      (top:2.05″, bottom:2.05″, left/inside: 1.73″, right/outside: 1.73″), line
      spacing ( ‘single’ ), and font style ( ‘Times’ ), font sizes (Title: 14pt
      – bold, Abstract: 9 pt, Keywords: 9 pt, Section header : 12 pt – bold,
      Subsection header: 10 pt – bold, Table and figure caption: 10 pt – bold,
      Text body: 10 pt) as prescribed in Springer CCIS template, do not manually
      alter ANY of these parameters. 11.Verify the referencing style of CCIS,
      which will help to produce the correct reference format. A reference
      should bear the following parameters in proper format: author name(s), the
      title of article/book, conference/journal name, volume, issue, page
      numbers, and publication year. 12.Any article, not in format, will be
      subjected to rejection without any judgement on its quality. 13.The
      articles should be the own work of the authors. The proper acknowledgment
      should be given if any work is referred from others (or some other work by
      the author). Plagiarism of any type, if detected, will lead to rejection
      of the articles anytime.
